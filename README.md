# Google API's Book Search
## Created for Chingu

A pre-work project created for Chingu, that builds a page to search books through Google's Books API.
It will display a book title, image, author, publisher, published date and link to more external results.

This will still be refined, but the overall functionality is there and can handle some more odd queries/missing book data.
The site is also quite mobile-friendly and usable, although not directly built for mobile usage.
It was built with HTML, CSS, Vanilla JS and some jQuery to handle the API.
